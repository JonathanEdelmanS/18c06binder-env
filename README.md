# Sample Binder Environment (Python, Julia) for MIT math courses

This is the git repository for a binder environment with the Python and Julia

(In the future, we plan to add a [repo2docker Github Action](https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker-action) to automatically build push changes to dockerhub and speed up the launch of binder.)

To create a link to load notebooks in a particular course, use [nbgitpuller](https://github.com/jupyterhub/nbgitpuller), similar to [this example](https://github.com/gvarnavi/binder-env_py-3.8_jl-1.6_wl-12.2).  Click the following link just to open the "bare" binder environment for this repo with no notebooks:
